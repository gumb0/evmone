> Fast Ethereum Virtual Machine implementation

_evmone_ is a C++ implementation of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). 
Created by members of the [Ewasm] team, the project aims for clean, standalone EVM implementation 
that can be imported as an execution module by Ethereum Client projects. 
The codebase of _evmone_ is optimized to provide fast and efficient execution of EVM smart contracts.

#### Characteristic of evmone

1. Exposes the [EVMC] API.
2. The "indirect" subroutine threading is the dispatch method - 
   a table with pointers to subroutines is prepared during the analysis of the bytecode.
3. The gas cost and stack requirements of block of instructions is precomputed 
   and applied once per block during execution.
4. The [intx] library is used to provide 256-bit integer precision.
5. The [ethash] library is used to provide Keccak hash function implementation
   needed for the special `SHA3` instruction.
6. Requires C++17 standard.

## Usage

To build the evmone EVMC module (shared library), test or benchmark.

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/ethereum/evmone
cd evmone
mkdir build
cd build

cmake .. -DEVMONE_TESTING=ON
cmake --build . -- -j

bin/evmone-unittests
bin/evmone-bench
```

### Tools

#### evm-test

The **evm-test** executes a collection of unit tests on 
any EVMC-compatible Ethereum Virtual Machine implementation.
The collection of tests comes from the evmone project.

```bash
evm-test ./evmone.so
```
